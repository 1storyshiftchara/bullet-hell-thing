to use this you'll need python and pygame

python download: https://www.python.org/downloads/
(https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python python extension for visual studio code)
to install pygame you need pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

to install pygame just type in a command promp: pip install pygame

other then that i would suggest use visual studio code or visual studio 2019

visual studio code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
visual studio 2019: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

once you have all that done just install git (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) then

1. make a folder where you want the bullet hell engine to be
2. cd into the folder in a command line promp (cd (file location))
3. type in the command line git clone https://github.com/1storyshiftchara/bullet-hell-thing

if your using  visual studio code you have to cd into the bullet hell file then type code .
if your using visual studio 2019 you just have to right click while inside the folder then click "open with visual studio 2019"

documentation on how to use this is in the main.py file
