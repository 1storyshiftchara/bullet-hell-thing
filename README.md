to use this you'll need python and pygame

python download: https://www.python.org/downloads/

to install pygame you need pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/

to install pygame just type in a command promp: pip install pygame

other then that i would suggest use visual studio code or visual studio 2019

https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/

once you have all that done just install git then

1. make a folder where you want the bullet hell engine to be
2. cd into the folder in a command line promp (cd (file location))
3. type in the command line git clone https://github.com/1storyshiftchara/bullet-hell-thing
